# pcep-notes
Notes for my PCEP cert. Do I even need this?

## to-do list
* go through videos
* flashcards if there's anything I don't already know
* take PCEP test

## PCEP sections and mapping
1. Fundamentals ➡️ Module 1 & 2
2. Control Flow ➡️ Module 3
3. Data Collections ➡️ Module 4
4. Functions and Exceptions ➡️ Module 5

## module 1: basic concepts
* covers ```print```
    * printing apostophes using double quotes around singles
    * using escape character
    * all prints have a newline at the end
    * ```\n``` is newline
* variables
    * must start with a letter or underscore, no numbers
    * case sensitive
    * protected names (from, global, etc.)
* data types
    * strings
    * int (whole numbers)
    * floats (decimals)
    * boolean (```True``` or ```False```, case sensitive)
    * COMMENT: more types to come later...
* comments
    * uses hash, turns rest of the line into comment
* numerical representations
    * as of 3.6, you can use underscores in numbers to improve readability
        * ```12_000_300``` = ```120003000```
    * scientific notation
        * 3e4 or 3E4 = 3 * 10000 = 30000
        * 3e-4 = 3 * .0001 = .0003
    * octal numbers
        * ```0o123```
    * hex
        * ```0x123```
* operators
    * addition +
    * subtraction -
    * multiplication *
    * division
        * / standard, produces float, regardless of dividing ints
        * // integer division, nearest whole number, rounded down
        * % modulo, returns just remainder
        * never divide by zero (ZeroDivisionError)
    * powers/exponents **
* extra: how does modulo work?
    

## module 2: data types, evals, basic i/o

## module 3: control flow, conditionals, loops

## module 4: data collections

## module 5: functions and exceptions
